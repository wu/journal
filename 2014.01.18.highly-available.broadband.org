Here are some notes about my dual-wan setup with hardware redundancy.

My goal here was to be able to yank any cable or lose any device and
never be dead in the water.  The worst single point of failure in my
current setup is the main intranet switch.

If you plan to go dual-wan with two routers in an HA configuration, I
don't recommend this setup.  The thing I didn't know when purchasing
this hardware is that you ideally need a fourth interface to dedicate
to pfSync.  I currently have my CARP routed over the LAN interface,
which works great but was a little tricky to get working initially.
