I have two identical FreeBSD servers at home, on which I run a bunch
of Virtualbox VMs.  Under normal conditions, around half of the VMs
are running on each server.  When I want to upgrade one of the
physical machines, I first migrate all the VMs over to the other one.

Here is a little script I recently whipped up to migrate a given VM
from one physical host to the other.
