I've been through many iterations of refinements on my emacs org-mode
agenda sorting.  I have been extremely happy with my latest iteration
over the last few months, so I thought I'd share.

Here's my org-agenda-sorting-strategy:

#+begin_src lisp
  (setq org-agenda-sorting-strategy
        (quote ((agenda habit-down time-up scheduled-down deadline-down priority-down category-keep)
                (todo category-up priority-down effort-up)
                (tags category-up priority-down effort-up)
                (search category-up))))

#+end_src

Here's how that breaks down:

  - habit-down - habits are displayed at the very bottom to keep them
    separated from my normal task list [E].

  - time-up - entries that are scheduled for a specific time today are
    on the very top, above everything else [A].

  - scheduled-down - tasks that are scheduled for today are on top
    [C], and tasks that are scheduled for a previous day are sorted by
    the number of days they are old [D].

  - deadline-down - deadlines fall below tasks that are scheduled for
    a specific time today [B].  Deadlines that are in the future are
    on top, and deadlines that are overdue are on bottom.

  - priority-down - tasks that are due on the same day are sorted by
    their priority.

  - category-keep - last sort is by category by sequence in `org-agenda-files'

I try to practice ubiquitous capture, so I am constantly adding new
items to my task lists.  I can be a bit overly optimistic during the
planning phase, so my task queue does occasionally grow faster than I
can mark tasks done.  So I find it very useful to treat my task list
like a queue, with the items sorted by age.  The things I have
scheduled for today are at the top of my list, sorted by priority.
Things that have a scheduled date in the past are sorted by the number
of days they are old.

I can always bring any old task back up near the top of the queue by
resetting the 'scheduled' date to today.  But I generally try to avoid
resetting the 'scheduled' date on any item unless I have actually
worked on that item today.  That way, just by looking at the task in
my queue, I can tell how long it has been since I've made progress on
it.  It also makes it really obvious which tasks are getting 'stuck'.

If my task list starts to get impossibly long, I go to the bottom of
the list to find the tasks that have been untouched for the longest,
and I add a 'stuck' tag to them.  Then my configuration excludes them
from my default agenda views.  I have some extra agenda views to see
the stuck tasks, and a daily task to review them.
