I maintain a bunch of FreeBSD VMs and a handful of physical machines.
There are three phases to the build of each box:

  1. base OS and configure network interface
  2. OS updates and get puppet running
  3. finish the build with puppet

Here's my process for step #2.

#+begin_src sh
  # on puppetmaster
  puppet cert clean {fqdn}

  # on the host being built
  fetch -o - https://raw.github.com/wu/journal/master/files/freebsd-bootstrap.sh | sh -s {hostname}

  # on puppetmaster
  puppet cert --sign {fqdn}

#+end_src

More on step #1 and #3 at a later date...
