Here are some notes about my dual-wan setup with hardware redundancy
using [[http://www.pfsense.org/][pfsense]].

My goal here was to be able to yank any cable or lose any single
device and never be dead in the water.  The most significant [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure][SPOF]] in
my current setup is the main intranet switch.

I have a couple of these, which are labeled gw1 and gw2 in the diagram.

If you plan to go dual-wan with two routers in an HA configuration, I
don't recommend this hardware.  The thing I didn't know when
purchasing this hardware is that you ideally need a fourth interface
to dedicate to pfSync.  I currently have my CARP routed over the LAN
interface, which works great but was a little tricky to get working
initially.

I also have a few older models of these, which are labeled power-01
and power-02 in the diagram.

I replaced the fans on both of these as they were pretty loud (one was
particularly noisy).
